ParsePushNotificationProjectApp
===============================

My first attempt at push notifications using the Parse system.  You will need to create a Parse account if you want to test this out.  Create a "Constants.h/.m" and replace the CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET with your apps credentials.

This is a project app intended to use the Parse system and send a notification upon pressing a button from the viewController.  Only works on devices.
